# Civic issue reporting and resolution system

## Problem Statement

In many cities and towns, civic issues such as potholes, streetlight failures, garbage overflow, water leakage, and sanitation problems are often reported through informal channels. This leads to delayed resolution, lack of accountability, and poor transparency.

The Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution System aims to provide a centralized, transparent, and technology-driven platform where citizens can report civic issues and authorities can efficiently manage, track, and resolve them.

## Project Overview

The system consists of two independent web applications:

   **1. User Portal** – for citizens to report and track civic issues

   **2. Admin Portal** – for authorities to manage complaints and resolutions

Both portals are built using modern frontend technologies and follow a scalable, modular architecture.
